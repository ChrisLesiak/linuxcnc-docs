# some of EMC2 History & News
#############################

2006.03.18 - A new pin "count" exists for freqgen.  It is the same as the 
             internal symbol "count" shown in the hal introduction.pdf,
             or the result of up OR down if there was an "OR" component.

2006.03.16 - Modified the motion control module to behave more like other
             HAL modules - it no longer adds its functions to threads
             automatically.  All the sample configs have been changed to
             explicitly add the functions, users who have custom configs
             will need to do the same.

2006.03.12 - If a copy of axis 1.3a0 or newer is detected inside src/
             it will be automatically built and installed for
             --enable-run-in-place use

2006.03.10 - minor bugfix in tkemc for jogging

2006.03.10 - added genhexkins, with a minitetra sample config. 
             This proves EMC2 works just as good with hexapods as EMC1 did.

2006.03.10 - added VTI support & sample configs

2006.03.07 - lots of fixes to the TP (most were wrong in the old one as well)

2006.03.05 - new Trajectory Planner

2006.02.20 - added a manpage for the runscript.

2006.02.12 - Fixed a bug that was causing the RT code to run very slowly,
             forcing users to set BASE_PERIOD very long.

2006.02.10 - The build process has been replaced, no more recursive $(MAKE)

2006.01.28 - fixed bug #1205237, mode switching sometimes hung

2006.01.08 - M62/M63 digital outputs synchronous to motion
             M64/M65 digital outputs that get set right away
	     
2006.01.06 - work on halconfig.tcl, it is used to display/configure HAL data
             requires the BWidget package, realtime, and HAL to run.

2006.01.04 - fix bug #1387740, a motion that goes nowhere clears feedrate

2006.01.01 - the config picker has i18n support, a German translation exists

2005.12.20 - a new config picker has been written, if you start just the 
             runscript this one helps you choose a config to run

2005.12.13 - new runscript, and config organization
             work towards the first release of EMC2

2005.xx.xx - EMC2 now supports tool-changing in complex scenarios
	    
2005.xx.xx - classicladder now a HAL component, a software PLC
	   
2004.xx.xx - HAL (the Hardware Abstraction Layer) is used for 
	     addressing hardware drivers, and allows for simple configuration


#developers: this file should hold a history of improvements, bugfixes, etc
             it is useful for keeping track of development
