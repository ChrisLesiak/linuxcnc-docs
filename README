Mission Statement
-----------------

EMC2 is an offshoot of the original NIST Enhanced Machine
Controller.  The new version is (primarily) a GPL'd project.
The major goals are:

1)  Make the project more friendly to new developers.  This
    means a simpler build process, as well as other changes
    listed below. (DONE)

2)  Reduce complexity by eliminating support for platforms
    other than Linux on x86, with either RTAI or RTLinux for
    realtime. (DONE)

3)  Incorporate a Hardware Abstraction Layer that makes the
    realtime code more modular and allows pins and I/O devices
    to be reconfigured easily. (DONE)

4)  Add some of the features that were discussed at the 2003
    NAMES show on EMC Monday - these include rigid tapping
    and single point threading, improved contouring, a built-
    in PLC using ClassicLadder, and others. (mostly DONE, yet
    new features will constantly be added)


The Build Process
-----------------

Refer to the file 'docs/INSTALL' for information about building and 
running the software.
    

Directory Layout
----------------

The directory tree for EMC2 is documented in 'directory.map' in the
top level directory.

A Note on using Lyx
-------------------

By adding a package to the preamble it is possible to include the 
TOC starting page in the TOC itself.  That way it will appear in
the side bar of the PDF readers and allow the user to click back
to where they last were when they clicked on a TOC entry.

That line is \usepackage{tocbibind} and it seems to work fine right
below the line that colors and creates the TOC links.

It is also possible to add other references to the TOC for things 
like sections or chapters that are not numbered (chapter*) by including
and ERT (Evil Red Text) while running the Lyx GUI itself.  An example
this is shown below.  What it does is add the user handbook Foreward
to the TOC when the first line of userforward.lyx has been changed
to an unnumbered chapter.

The line is listed below.  You'd need to change "Forword" for your
own entry's name.  This ERT should be added immediately after the
lines that insert a file or create a new heading you wish to add.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\protect\numberline{}Foreword}
 
It also looks like we need to modify the header variable that is 
used for the top of each page to reflect the new info.  This can
be done by placing the following ERT immediately before the item
to be added.

\markboth{Foreword}{Foreword}

Change "Foreword" to the name you wish to show.
