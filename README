A Note on using Lyx
-------------------

By adding a package to the preamble it is possible to include the 
TOC starting page in the TOC itself.  That way it will appear in
the side bar of the PDF readers and allow the user to click back
to where they last were when they clicked on a TOC entry.

That line is \usepackage{tocbibind} and it seems to work fine right
below the line that colors and creates the TOC links.

It is also possible to add other references to the TOC for things 
like sections or chapters that are not numbered (chapter*) by including
and ERT (Evil Red Text) while running the Lyx GUI itself.  An example
this is shown below.  What it does is add the user handbook Foreward
to the TOC when the first line of userforward.lyx has been changed
to an unnumbered chapter.

The line is listed below.  You'd need to change "Forword" for your
own entry's name.  This ERT should be added before the
lines that insert a file or create a new heading you wish to add.
The ERT is Insert/TeX on the lyx menu.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\protect\numberline{}Foreword}

This line is optional and adds a page title... 
It also looks like we need to modify the header variable that is 
used for the top of each page to reflect the new info.  This can
be done by placing the following ERT immediately before the item
to be added.

\markboth{Foreword}{Foreword}

Change "Foreword" to the name you wish to show.
