.SH DESCRIPTION

hostmot2 is an RTAI device driver that interfaces the Mesa HostMot2
firmware to the EMC2 HAL.  This driver by itself does nothing, the boards
that actually run the firmware require their own drivers before anything
can happen.  Currently drivers are available for the 5i20 (hm2_5i20) and
the 7i43 (hm2_7i43).  Drivers for the other Mesa Electronics Anything
I/O boards are under active development and should be ready sometime
during the summer of 2008.

The HostMot2 firmware provides encoders, PWM generators, step/dir
generators, and general purpose I/O pins (GPIOs).  These things are
called "Modules".  The firmware is configured, at firmware compile time,
to provide zero or more instances of each of these four Modules.
.SH Board I/O Pins

The HostMot2 firmware runs on an FPGA board.  The board interfaces with
the computer via PCI or EPP, and interfaces with motion control hardware
such as servos and stepper motors via I/O pins on the boards.

Each I/O pin can be configured, at board-driver load time, to serve
one of two purposes: either as a particular I/O pin of a particular
Module instance (encoder, pwmgen, or stepgen), or as a general purpose
digital I/O pin.  By default all Module instances are enabled, and all
the board's pins are used by the Module instances.

The user can disable Module instances at board-driver load time, by
specifying a hostmot2 config string modparam.  Any pins which belong to
Module instances that have been disabled automatically become GPIOs.
.SH config modparam

The board-driver modules accept a config string modparam at load time.
This config string is passed to and parsed by the hostmot2 driver when
the board-driver registers a HostMot2 instance.  The format of the config
string is:

.B [firmware=\fIF\fB] [num_encoders=\fIN\fB] [num_pwmgens=\fIN\fB] [num_stepgens=\fIN\fB] [enable_raw]
.RS
.TP
\fBfirmware\fR [optional]
Load the firmware specified by F into the FPGA on this board.  If no
"\fBfirmware=\fIF\fR" string is specified, the FPGA will not be
programmed, and had better have a valid configuration already.
.P
.RS
The requested firmware F is fetched by udev.  udev searches for the
firmware in the system's firmware search path, usually /lib/firmware.
F typically has the form "hm2/<BoardType>/file.bit"; a typical value
for F might be "hm2/5i20/SVST8_4.BIT".  If EMC2 is installed by the
Debian package (.deb), then the firmware files are already installed
in /lib/firmware.  If EMC2 is compiled from CVS and configured for
run-in-place, then the user must symlink the hostmot2 firmware into
/lib/firmware manually, by a command like this:
.P
.RS
\fBsudo ln -s $HOME/emc2-sandbox/src/hal/drivers/mesa-hostmot2/firmware
/lib/firmware/hm2\fR
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fBnum_encoders\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N encoders.  If N is -1, all encoders are enabled.
If N is 0, no encoders are enabled.  If N is greater than the number of
encoders available in the firmware, the board will fail to register.
.TP
\fBnum_pwmgens\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N pwmgens.  If N is -1, all pwmgens are enabled.
If N is 0, no pwmgens are enabled.  If N is greater than the number of
pwmgens available in the firmware, the board will fail to register.
.TP
\fBnum_stepgens\fR [optional, default: -1]
Only enable the first N stepgens.  If N is -1, all stepgens are enabled.
If N is 0, no stepgens are enabled.  If N is greater than the number of
stepgens available in the firmware, the board will fail to register.
.TP
\fBenable_raw\fR [optional]
If specified, this turns on a raw access mode, whereby a user can peek and
poke the firmware from HAL.  See Raw Mode below.

.SH encoder

Very basic support, more to come.  This is what's implemented so far:

Encoders have names like "hm2_<BoardType>.<BoardNum>.encoder.<Instance>".
Instance is a two-digit number that corresponds to the HostMot2 encoder
instance number.  There are 'num_encoders' instances, starting with 00.

In HM2, each encoder uses three input IO pins: A, B, and Index (sometimes
also known as Z).  Index is currently not used, this will be fixed in
the nearish future.

Each encoder instance has the following pins and parameters:

Pins:

(s32 out) count: Number of encoder counts since the previous reset.
(Like CDI.)

(float out) position: Encoder position (count / scale).  (Like CDI.)

Parameters:

(float r/w) scale: Converts from 'count' units to 'position' units.
(Like CDI.)
.SH pwmgen

Very basic support, more to come.  This is what's implemented so far:

pwmgens have names like "hm2_<BoardType>.<BoardNum>.pwmgen.<Instance>".
Instance is a two-digit number that corresponds to the HostMot2 pwmgen
instance number.  There are 'num_pwmgens' instances, starting with 00.

In HM2, each pwmgen uses three output IO pins: Not-Enable, Out0, and
Out1.

The function of the Out0 and Out1 IO pins varies with output-type
parameter (see below).

The pwmgen representation is modeled on the pwmgen software component.
Each pwmgen instance has the following pins and parameters:

Pins:

(bit input) enable: If true, the pwmgen will set its Not-Enable pin
false and output its PWM and Direction signals.  If 'enable' is false,
pwmgen will set its Not-Enable pin true and not output any signals.

(float input) value: The current pwmgen command value, in arbitrary units.

Parameters:

(float rw) scale: Scaling factor to convert 'value' from arbitrary units
to duty cycle: dc = value / scale.  Duty cycle has an effective range
of -1.0 to +1.0 inclusive.

(s32 rw) output-type: This emulates the output_type load-time argument
to the software pwmgen component.  This parameter may be changed at
runtime, but most of the time you probably want to set it at startup and
then leave it alone.  Accepted values are 1 (PWM on Out0 and Direction
on Out1) and 2 (Up on Out0 and Down on Out1).
.SH stepgen

Very basic support.  This is what's implemented so far:

stepgens have names like "hm2_<BoardType>.<BoardNum>.stepgen.<Instance>.
Instance is a two-digit number that corresponds to the HostMot2 stepgen
instance number.  There are 'num_stepgens' instances, starting with 00.

Currently only Step/Dir output and Position-mode control is supported.

Each stepgen allocates 6 IO pins, but only uses two: Step and Direction
outputs.

The stepgen representation is modeled on the stepgen software component.
Each stepgen instance has the following pins and parameters:

Pins:

(float input) position_cmd: Target of stepper motion, in arbitrary
position units.

(float output) counts: Feedback position in counts (number of steps).

(float output) position-fb: Feedback position in arbitrary position units
(counts / position_scale).

(float output) velocity-fb: Feedback velocity in arbitrary position
units per second.

Parameters:

(float r/w) position_scale: Converts from counts to position units.
position = counts / position_scale

(float r/w) steplen: Duration of the step signal, in seconds.

(float r/w) stepspace: Minimum interval between step signals, in seconds.

(float r/w) dirsetup: Minimum duration of stable Direction signal before
a step begins, in seconds.

(float r/w) dirhold: Minimum duration of stable Direction signal after
a step ends, in seconds.
.SH General Purpose I/O

I/O Pins on the board which are not used by one of the Module instances
above are exported to HAL as GPIO pins.  GPIO pins have names like
"hm2_<BoardType>.<BoardNum>.gpio.<PortName>.<PinNum>".  PinNum is a
three-digit number.  PortName and PinNum correspond to the I/O Pin info
as given in Mesa Electronics' manual for the board.

Each GPIO has the following HAL Pins:

(bit out) in & in_not: State (normal and inverted) of the hardware
input pin.  (Like CDI for Digital Input).

(bit in) out: Value to be written (possibly inverted) to the hardware
output pin.  (Like the CDI for Digital Output.)

Each GPIO has the following Parameters:

(bin r/w) is_output: If set to 1, the GPIO is an output, and the values
of the "in" and "in_not" HAL pins are undefined.  If set to 0, the GPIO
is an input, and writes to the "out" HAL pin have no effect.

(bin r/w) invert_output: If set to 1, the value that will appear on
the board's I/O pin will be the inverse of the value written to HAL's
"out" pin.  (This corresponds to the 'invert' parameter in the CDI for
Digital Output.)
.SH Watchdog

The HostMot2 firmware may include a watchdog Module; if it does,
the hostmot2 driver will use it.  The watchdog must be petted by EMC2
periodically or it will bite.  When the watchdog bites, all the board's
I/O pins are disconnected from their Module instances and become
high-impedance inputs (pulled high), and all communication with the
board stops.  Resetting the watchdog resumes communication and resets
the I/O pins to the configuration chosen at load-time.

If the firmware includes a watchdog, the following HAL objects will
be exported:

Pins:

(bit in/out) has_bit: True if the watchdog has bit, False if the watchdog has
not bit.  If the watchdog has bit and the has_bit bit is True, the user
can reset it to False to resume operation.

Parameters:

(u32 read/write) timeout_ns: Watchdog timeout, in nanoseconds.  This is initialized
to 1,000,000,000 (1 second) at module load time.  If more than this
amount of time passes between calls to the pet_watchdog() function,
the watchdog will bite.

Functions:

pet_watchdog(): Calling this function resets the watchdog timer and
postpones the watchdog biting until timeout_ns nanoseconds later.
.SH Raw Mode

If the "enable_raw" config keyword is specified, Raw mode is enabled.
Raw mode lets a user peek and poke the firmware from HAL.

Pins:

(u32 in) read_address: The bottom 16 bits of this is used as the address
to read from.

(u32 out) read_data: Each time the hm2_read() function is called, this
pin is updated with the value at .read_address.

(u32 in) write_address: The bottom 16 bits of this is used as the address
to write to.

(u32 in) write_data: This is the value to write to .write_address.

(bit in) write_strobe: Each time the hm2_write() function is called, this
pin is examined.  If it is True, then value in .write_data is written
to the address in .write_address, and .write_strobe is set back to False.
