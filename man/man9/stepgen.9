.SH NAME
freqgen, stepgen \- software step pulse generation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBloadrt freqgen step_type=\fItype0\fR[,\fItype1\fR...]
.br
\fBloadrt stepgen step_type=\fItype0\fR[,\fItype1\fR...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfreqgen\fR and \fBstepgen\fR are used to control stepper motors.  The maximum
step rate depends on the CPU and other factors, and is usually in the range of 10KHz to 50KHz.  If higher rates are needed, a hardware step generator is a better choice.
.P
\fBfreqgen\fR runs the motor at a commanded velocity, subject to acceleration and velocity limits.  \fBstepgen\fR drives the motor to a commanded position, again subject to accel and velocity limits.  Usually, \fBstepgen\fR is used for machine axes.  \fBfreqgen\fR is reserved for unusual applications where continuous movement at some speed is desired, instead of movement to a specific position.
.P
Either component can control a maximum of eight motors.  The number of motors/channels actually loaded depends on the number of \fItype\fR values given.
The value of each \fItype\fR determines the outputs for that channel.  Both components support the same 15 possible step types.
.P
By far the most common step type is '0', standard step and direction.  Others include up/down, quadrature, and a wide variety of three, four, and five phase patterns that can be used to directly control some types of motor windings.  (When used with appropriate buffers of course.)
.P
Some of the stepping types are described below, but for more details (including timing diagrams) see the \fBstepgen\fR section of the HAL reference manual.
.TP
type 0: step/dir
Two pins, one for step and one for direction.  \fBmake-pulses\fR must run at least twice for each step (once to set the step pin true, once to clear it).  This limits the maximum step rate to half (or less) of the rate that can be reached by types 2-14.  The parameters \fBsteplen\fR and \fBstepspace\fR can further lower the maximum step rate.  Parameters \fBdirsetup\fR and \fBdirhold\fR also apply to this step type.
.TP
type 1: up/down
Two pins, one for 'step up' and one for 'step down'.  Like type 0, \fBmake-pulses\fR must run twice per step, which limits the maximum speed.
.TP
type 2: quadrature
Two pins, phase-A and phase-B.  For forward motion, A leads B.  Can advance by one step every time \fBmake-pulses\fR runs.
.TP
type 3: three phase, full step
Three pins, phase-A, phase-B, and phase-C.  Three steps per full cycle, then repeats.  Only one phase is high at a time - for forward motion the pattern is A, then B, then C, then A again.
.TP
type 4: three phase, half step
Three pins, phases A through C.  Six steps per full cycle.  First A is high alone, then A and B together, then B alone, then B and C together, etc.
.TP
types 5 through 8: four phase, full step
Four pins, phases A through D.  Four steps per full cycle.  Types 5 and 6 are suitable for use with unipolar steppers, where power is applied to the center tap of each winding, and four open-collector transistors drive the ends.  Types 7 and 8 are suitable for bipolar steppers, driven by two H-bridges.
.TP
types 9 and 10: four phase, half step
Four pins, phases A through D.  Eight steps per full cycle.  Type 9 is suitable for unipolar drive, and type 10 for bipolar drive.
.TP
types 11 and 12: five phase, full step
Five pins, phases A through E.  Five steps per full cycle.  See HAL reference manual for the patterns.
.TP
types 13 and 14: five phase, half step
Five pins, phases A through E.  Ten steps per full cycle.  See HAL reference manual for the patterns.

.SH FUNCTIONS
.P
Note: \fImodule\fR can be either \fBfreqgen\fR or \fBstepgen\fR in the following
function names.
.TP 
\fB\fImodule\fB.make-pulses \fR(no floating-point)
Generates the step pulses, using information computed by \fBupdate-freq\fR.  Must be called as frequently as possible, to maximize the attainable step rate and minimize jitter.  Operates on all channels at once.
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.capture-position \fR(uses floating point)
Captures position feedback value from the high speed code and makes it available on a pin for use elsewhere in the system.  Operates on all channels at once.
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.update-freq \fR(uses floating point)
Accepts a velocity (\fBfreqgen\fR) or position (\fBstepgen\fR) command and converts it into a form usable by \fBmake-pulses\fR for step generation.  Operates on all
channels at once.

.SH PARAMETERS
.P
Note: \fImodule\fR can be either \fBfreqgen\fR or \fBstepgen\fR in the following
parameter names.
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.\fIN\fB.frequency\fR float ro
The current step rate, in steps per second, for channel \fIN\fR.
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.\fIN\fB.maxaccel\fR float rw
The acceleration/deceleration limit.  For \fBfreqgen\fR it is in steps per second squared, for \fBstepgen\fR it is in length units per second squared.
.TP
\fBfreqgen.\fIN\fB.maxfreq\fR float rw (\fBfreqgen\fR only)
The maximum allowable velocity, in steps per second.  If the requested maximum velocity cannot be reached with the current \fBmake-pulses\fR thread period, it will be reset to the highest attainable value.
.TP
\fBstepgen.\fIN\fB.maxvel\fR float rw (\fBstepgen\fR only)
The maximum allowable velocity, in length units per second.  If the requested maximum velocity cannot be reached with the current combination of scaling and \fBmake-pulses\fR thread period, it will be reset to the highest attainable value.
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.\fIN\fB.position-scale\fR float rw
The scaling for position feedback (and \fBstepgen\fR position command), in steps per length unit.
.TP
\fBfreqgen.\fIN\fB.velocity-scale\fR float rw (\fBfreqgen\fR only)
The scaling for the velocity command, in steps per length unit.
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.\fIN\fB.rawcounts\fR s32 ro
The position in counts, as updated by \fBmake-pulses\fR.  (Note: this is updated more frequently than the \fBcounts\fR pin.)
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.\fIN\fB.steplen\fR u32 rw (step type 0 only)

.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.\fIN\fB.stepspace\fR u32 rw (step type 0 only)
The minimum space between step pulses, in \fBmake-pulses\fR periods.  Measured from falling edge to rising edge.  The actual time depends on the step rate and can be much longer.
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.\fIN\fB.dirsetup\fR u32 rw (step type 0 only)
The minimum setup time from direction to step, in \fBmake-pulses\fR periods.  Measured from change of direction to rising edge of step.
.TP
\fB\fImodule\fB.\fIN\fB.dirhold\fR u32 rw (step type 0 only)
The minimum hold time of direction after step, in \fBmake-pulses\fR periods.  Measured from falling edge of step to change of direction.

.SH BUGS
\fBfreqgen\fR should have an \fBenable\fR pin.
.P
\fBfreqgen\fR's command pin should be called \fBvelocity-cmd\fR, not \fBvelocity\fR, for clarity and consistency with \fBstepgen\fR.
.P
\fBfreqgen\fR should use \fBmaxvel\fR, not \fBmaxfreq\fR. (In other words, the velocity limit should be scaled in length units per second, not steps per second.  The scale parameter can be set to 1.0 if it is desired to work in steps instead of length units.)
.P
\fBfreqgen\fR's maxaccel parameter should be in length units per second squared, not steps per second squared, for consistency with \fBstepgen\fR.
.P
\fBfreqgen\fR should use \fBposition-scale\fR for scaling both command and feedback, \fBvelocity-scale\fR is redundant and should be eliminated.
.P
Step type 1 (up/down) should respect the \fBsteplen\fR and \fBstepspace\fR limits.
.P
Timing parameters \fBsteplen\fR, \fBstepspace\fR, \fBdirsetup\fR, and \fBdirhold\fR should be in nano-seconds, not \fBmake-pulses\fR periods.  That would allow the period to be changed without requiring the parameters to be recalculated.
.P
Most of these will be fixed in version 2.2, rather than 2.1.x, because they
represent changes in the public interface (different pin names or behaviors).
