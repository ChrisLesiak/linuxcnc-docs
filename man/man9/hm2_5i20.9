.SH DESCRIPTION

hm2_5i20 is an RTAI device driver that interfaces the Mesa 5i20 board with
the HostMot2 firmware to the EMC2 HAL.

The driver programs the board's FPGA with firmware when it registers
the board with the hostmot2 driver.  The old bfload(1) firmware loading
method is not used anymore.  Instead the firmware to load is specified
in the \fBconfig\fR modparam, as described in the hostmot2(9) manpage,
in the \fIconfig modparam\fR section.
