.SH NAME
bfload \- A program for loading a Xilinx Bitfile program into the FPGA
of an Anything I/O board from Mesa Electronics.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program loads a Xilinx bitfile-format FPGA program into the FPGA of an Anything I/O board from Mesa Electronics.
Currently supported boards:
.IP
5i20
.IP
7i43 (both the 200K and 400K FPGA models)

.SH OPTIONS
The first command-line forms do not program an FPGA.
.IP
.B help
Prints terse usage info.
.IP
.B list
Lists all the supported PCI Anything I/O boards in the system.
.P
The last command-line form tries to program the FPGA of an Anything I/O board.
.IP
.B BoardType
specifies the model name of a supported Anything I/O board (see the DESCRIPTION section above).
.IP
.B BoardIdentifier
is optional.  Its format depends on the board type.  For PCI boards,
BoardIdentifier is an integer specifying the n'th discovered PCI board
of that type.  For EPP boards, BoardIdentifier is the I/O address of the
parallel port to use, in the format "IOAddr[,IOAddrHigh]".  If IOAddrHigh
is omitted, it defaults to IOAddr + 0x400.  If BoardIdentifier is omitted,
it defaults to "0" for PCI boards and "0x378" for EPP boards.
.IP
.B BitFile
is the name of the FPGA program file to send.

.SH EXAMPLE
# send the file SV12.BIT to the first 5i20 board in the system
.br
bfload 5i20=SV12.BIT
.PP
# send the file SV8B.BIT to the 7i43 at the specified address
.br
bfload 7i43:0xdc48,0xdc50=SV8B.BIT
