G-Code Examples
\layout Standard

After you install EMC2 several sample files are placed in the /nc_files
 folder.
 Make sure the sample file is appropriate for your machine before running.
 
\layout Section

Probing
\layout Subsection

Grid Probe
\layout Standard

File Name: gridprobe.ngc
\layout Standard

Description: Rectangular Probing
\layout Standard

This program repeatedly probes in a regular XY grid and writes the probed
 location to the file 'probe-results.txt' in the same directory as the .ini
 file.
\layout Subsection

Smart Probe
\layout Standard

File Name: smartprobe.ngc
\layout Standard

Description: Rectangular Probing 
\layout Standard

This program repeatedly probes in a regular XY grid and writes the probed
 location to the file 'probe-results.txt' in the same directory as the .ini
 file.
 This is improved from the grid probe file.
\layout Subsection

Tool Length Probe
\layout Standard

File Name: tool-lenght-probe.ngc
\layout Standard

Description: Tool Length Probing
\layout Standard

This program demonstrates how to measure tool lengths automatically using
 a switch hooked to the probe input.
 This is useful for machines without tool holders, where the length of a
 tool is different every time it is inserted.
\layout Section

Cutter Compensation
\layout Subsection

G1 Lead In Move
\layout Standard

File Name: comp-g1.ngc
\layout Standard

Description: Cutter compensation with straight lead in and out.
\layout Standard

This file demonstrates how to do a cutter compensation move using a G1 straight
 line lead in and lead out move.
 It is an error to have a G1 lead in move form a concave angle.
