\layout Standard

In the G Code prototypes the hyphen (
\family typewriter 
-
\family default 
) stands for a real value.
 
\layout Standard

A real value may be :
\layout Itemize

An explicit number, 
\family typewriter 
4
\layout Itemize

An expression, 
\family typewriter 
[2+2]
\family default 
 
\layout Itemize

A parameter value, 
\family typewriter 
#88
\family default 
 
\layout Itemize

A unary function value, 
\family typewriter 
acos[0]
\layout Standard

In most cases, if axis words (any or all of 
\family typewriter 
X-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
Y-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
Z-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
A-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
B-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
C-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
U-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
V-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
W-
\family default 
) are given, they specify a destination point.
 
\layout Standard

Axis numbers are in the currently active coordinate system, unless explicitly
 described as being in the absolute coordinate system.
 Where axis words are optional, any omitted axes will have their current
 value.
 
\layout Standard

Any items in the G Code prototypes not explicitly described as optional
 are required.
 
\layout Standard

The values following letters are often given as explicit numbers.
 Unless stated otherwise, the explicit numbers can be real values.
 For example, 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2
\family default 
 could equally well be written 
\family typewriter 
G[2*5] L[1+1]
\family default 
.
 If the value of parameter 100 were 2, 
\family typewriter 
G10 L#100
\family default 
 would also mean the same.
 
\layout Standard

If 
\family typewriter 
L-
\family default 
 is written in a prototype the 
\family typewriter 
"-
\family default 
" will often be referred to as the "L number", and so on for any other letter.

 The

A circular or helical arc is specified using either 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
 (clockwise arc) or 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 (counterclockwise arc).
 The axis of the circle or helix must be parallel to the X, Y, or Z-axis
 of the machine coordinate system.
 The axis (or, equivalently, the plane perpendicular to the axis) is selected
 with 
\family typewriter 
G17
\family default 
 (Z-axis, XY-plane), 
\family typewriter 
G18
\family default 
 (Y-axis, XZ-plane), or 
\family typewriter

 If the arc is circular, it lies in a plane parallel to the selected plane.
\layout Standard

If a line of code makes an arc and includes rotational axis motion, the
 rotational axes turn at a constant rate so that the rotational motion starts
 and finishes when the XYZ motion starts and finishes.
 Lines of this sort are hardly ever programmed.

If cutter radius compensation is active, the motion will differ from what
 is described here.

\layout Subsection

Center format arcs (preferred format)
\layout Standard

In the center format, the coordinates of the end point of the arc in the
 selected plane are specified along with the offsets of the center of the
 arc from the current location.
 In this format, it is OK if the end point of the arc is the same as the
 current point.
 
\layout Standard

It is an error if:
\layout Itemize

When the arc is projected on the selected plane, the distance from the current
 point to the center differs from the distance from the end point to the

 I and J are optional except that at least one of the two must be used.
 If only one is specified, the value of the other is taken as 0.
 If you include the Z word it will spiral.

Here is an example of a center format command to mill an arc: 
\family typewriter 
G17 G2 X10 Y16 I3 J4 Z9
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

That means to make a clockwise (as viewed from the positive z-axis) circular
 or helical arc whose axis is parallel to the Z-axis, ending where X=10,
 Y=16, and Z=9, with its center offset in the X direction by 3 units from
 the current X location and offset in the Y direction by 4 units from the
 current Y location.
 If the current location has X=7, Y=7 at the outset, the center will be
 at X=10, Y=11.
 If the starting value of Z is 9, this is a circular arc; otherwise it is
 a helical arc.
 The radius of this arc would be 5.
\layout Standard

In the center format, the radius of the arc is not specified, but it may
 be found easily as the distance from the center of the circle to either
 the current point or the end point of the arc.

\layout Subsection

Radius format arcs (discouraged format)
\layout Standard

In the radius format, the coordinates of the end point of the arc in the
 selected plane are specified along with the radius of the arc.
 Program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 R-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
).
 R is the radius.
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of the two words
 for the axes in the selected plane must be used.
 The R number is the radius.
 A positive radius indicates that the arc turns through less than 180 degrees,
 while a negative radius indicates a turn of more than 180 degrees.
 If the arc is helical, the value of the end point of the arc on the coordinate
 axis parallel to the axis of the helix is also specified.
\layout Standard

It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

both of the axis words for the axes of the selected plane are omitted
\layout Itemize

the end point of the arc is the same as the current point.
\layout Standard

It is not good practice to program radius format arcs that are nearly full
 circles or nearly semicircles because a small change in the location of
 the end point will produce a much larger change in the location of the
 center of the circle (and, hence, the middle of the arc).
 The magnification effect is large enough that rounding error in a number
 can produce out-of-tolerance cuts.
 For instance, a 1% displacement of the endpoint of a 180 degree arc produced
 a 7% displacement of the point 90 degrees along the arc.
 Nearly full circles are even worse.
 Other size arcs (in the range tiny to 165 degrees or 195 to 345 degrees)
 are OK.
\layout Standard

Here is an example of a radius format command to mill an arc:
\family typewriter 
 G17 G2 x 10 y 15 r 20 z 5.
\layout Standard

That means to make a clockwise (as viewed from the positive Z-axis) circular
 or helical arc whose axis is parallel to the Z-axis, ending where X=10,
 Y=15, and Z=5, with a radius of 20.
 If the starting value of Z is 5, this is an arc of a circle parallel to
 the XY-plane; otherwise it is a helical arc.

.
\layout Standard

To set the origin of a coordinate system, program 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2 P- 
\emph on

\family default 
\emph default 
, where the P number is in the range 1 to 9 (corresponding to 
\family typewriter

\family default 
 to 
\family typewriter 
G59.3
\family default 
) and all axis words are optional.
 The origin of the coordinate system specified by the P number is set to
 the given values (in terms of the not offset machine coordinate system).
 Only those coordinates for which an axis word is included on the line will
 be set.
 Being in incremental distance mode (
\family typewriter

\layout Standard

It is an error if:

\layout Standard

The coordinate system whose origin is set by a 
\family typewriter 
G10
\family default 
 command may be active or inactive at the time the 
\family typewriter

 is executed.
 If it is currently active, the new coordinates take effect immediately.
\layout Standard

Example: 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2 P1 x 3.5 y 17.2
\family default 
 sets the origin of the first coordinate system (the one selected by 
\family typewriter 
G54
\family default 
) to be X=3.5 and Y=17.2.
 Because only X and Y are specified, the origin point is only moved in X

 coming to a complete stop.
  
\layout Standard

G64 without P means to keep the  best speed possible, no matter how far
 away from the programmed point  you end up.
  
\layout Standard

G64 P- means that it should slow down as required to keep  no more than
 P- away from the programmed endpoint.
  In addition, when  you activate G64 P- it turns on the "naive cam detector";
 when there are a series of linear XYZ feed moves at the same feed rate
 that are less than P- away from being collinear, they are collapsed into
 a single linear move.
 On G2/3 moves in the G17 (XY) plane when the maximum deviation of an arc
 from a straight line is less than the G64 P- tolerance the arc is broken
 into two lines (from start of arc to midpoint, and from midpoint to end).
 those lines are then subject to the naive cam algorithm for lines.
 Thus, line-arc, arc-arc, and arc-line cases as well as line-line benefit
 from the "naive cam detector".
 This improves contouring performance by simplifying the path.
 It is OK to program for the mode that is already active.

\layout Standard

Unless using an exit taper, the exit move (traverse to original X) is not
 synchronized to the spindle speed.
 With a slow spindle, the exit move might take only a small fraction of
 a revolution.
 If the spindle speed is increased after several passes are complete, subsequent
 exit moves will require a larger portion of a revolution, resulting in
 a very heavy cut during the exit move.
 This can be avoided by providing a relief groove at the exit, or by not
 changing the spindle speed while threading.

\layout Standard

The canned cycles 
\family typewriter 
G81
\family default 
 through 
\family typewriter 
G89
\family default 
 are described in this section.
 Two examples are given with the description of 
\family typewriter 
G81
\family default 
 below.
\layout Standard

All canned cycles are performed with respect to the currently-selected plane.
 Any of the six planes may be selected.
 Throughout this section, most of the descriptions assume the XY-plane has
 been selected.
 The behavior is analogous if another plane is selected, and the correct
 words must be used.
 For instance, in the 
\family typewriter 
G17.1
\family default 
 plane, the action of the canned cycle is along W, and the locations or
 increments are given with U and V.
 In this case substitute U,V,W for X,Y,Z in the instructions below.
\layout Standard

Rotational axis words are allowed in canned cycles, but it is better to
 omit them.
 If rotational axis words are used, the numbers must be the same as the
 current position numbers so that the rotational axes do not move.
\layout Subsection

Common Words
\layout Standard

All canned cycles use X, Y, R, and Z words.
 The R (usually meaning retract) position is along the axis perpendicular
 to the currently selected plane (Z-axis for XY-plane, etc.) Some canned
 cycles use additional arguments.
\layout Subsection

Sticky Words
\layout Standard

For canned cycles, we will call a number 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

sticky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 if, when the same cycle is used on several lines of code in a row, the
 number must be used the first time, but is optional on the rest of the
 lines.
 Sticky numbers keep their value on the rest of the lines if they are not
 explicitly programmed to be different.
 The R number is always sticky.
\layout Standard

In incremental distance mode X, Y, and R numbers are treated as increments
 from the current position and Z as an increment from the Z-axis position
 before the move involving Z takes place.
 In absolute distance mode, the X, Y, R, and Z numbers are absolute positions
 in the current coordinate system.
\layout Standard

The L number is optional and represents the number of repeats.
 
\begin_inset Formula $L=0$
\end_inset 

 is not allowed.
 If the repeat feature is used, it is normally used in incremental distance
 mode, so that the same sequence of motions is repeated in several equally
 spaced places along a straight line.
 In absolute distance mode, 
\begin_inset Formula $L>1$
\end_inset 

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

do the same cycle in the same place several times,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Omitting the L word is equivalent to specifying 
\begin_inset Formula $L=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The L number is not sticky.
\layout Subsection

Repeat Cycle
\layout Standard

When L- is greater than 1 in incremental mode with the XY-plane selected,
 the X and Y positions are determined by adding the given X and Y numbers
 either to the current X and Y positions (on the first go-around) or to
 the X and Y positions at the end of the previous go-around (on the repetitions).
 Thus, if you program 
\family typewriter 
L10
\family default 
, you will get 10 cycles.
 The first cycle will be distance X,Y from the original location.
 The R and Z positions do not change during the repeats.
\layout Subsection

Retract Mode
\layout Standard

The height of the retract move at the end of each repeat (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

clear Z
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the descriptions below) is determined by the setting of the retract
 mode: either to the original Z position (if that is above the R position
 and the retract mode is 
\family typewriter 
G98
\family default 
, OLD_Z), or otherwise to the R position.
 See Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:G98,-G99:-Set}

\end_inset 


\layout Subsection

Canned Cycle Errors
\layout Standard

It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

X, Y, and Z words are all missing during a canned cycle, 
\layout Itemize

a P number is required and a negative P number is used, 
\layout Itemize

an L number is used that does not evaluate to a positive integer, 
\layout Itemize

rotational axis motion is used during a canned cycle, 
\layout Itemize

inverse time feed rate is active during a canned cycle, 
\layout Itemize

or cutter radius compensation is active during a canned cycle.
\layout Standard

If the XY plane is active, the Z number is sticky, and it is an error if:
 
\layout Itemize

the Z number is missing and the same canned cycle was not already active,
 
\layout Itemize

or the R number is less than the Z number.
\layout Standard

If other planes are active, the error conditions are analogous to the XY
 conditions above.
\layout Subsection

Preliminary and In-Between Motion
\layout Standard

At the very beginning of the execution of any of the canned cycles, if the
 current Z position is below the R position, the Z-axis is traversed to
 the R position.
 This happens only once, regardless of the value of L.
\layout Standard

In addition, at the beginning of the first cycle and each repeat, the following
 one or two moves are made
\layout Enumerate

a straight traverse parallel to the XY-plane to the given XY-position, 
\layout Enumerate

a straight traverse of the Z-axis only to the R position, if it is not already
 at the R position.
 
\layout Standard

If another plane is active, the preliminary and in-between motions are analogous.

 In absolute distance mode, axis numbers (X, Y, Z, A, B, C, U, V, W) usually
 represent positions in terms of the currently active coordinate system.
 Any exceptions to that rule are described explicitly in this Section

 for more information on Offsets.
\layout Standard

To make the current point have the coordinates you want (without motion),
 program 
\family typewriter 
G92 X- Y- Z- A- B- C- U- V- W- 
\family default 
, where the axis words contain the axis numbers you want.
 All axis words are optional, except that at least one must be used.
 If an axis word is not used for a given axis, the coordinate on that axis
 of the current point is not changed.
 It is an error if: 
\layout Enumerate

all axis words are omitted.
\layout Standard

When 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 is executed, the origins of all coordinate systems move.
 They move such that the value of the current controlled point, in the currently
 active coordinate system, becomes the specified value.
 All coordinate systems' origins are offset this same distance.
 
\layout Standard

For example, suppose the current point is at X=4 and there is currently
 no 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 offset active.
 Then 
\family typewriter 
G92 x7
\family default 
 is programmed.
 This moves all origins -3 in X, which causes the current point to become
 X=7.
 This -3 is saved in parameter 5211.
\layout Standard

Being in incremental distance mode has no effect on the action of 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
.
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 offsets may be already be in effect when the 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 is called.
 If this is the case, the offset is replaced with a new offset that makes
 the current point become the specified value.
\layout Standard

To reset axis offsets to zero, program 
\family typewriter 
G92.1
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
G92.2
\family default 
.
 
\family typewriter 
G92.1
\family default 
 sets parameters 5211 to 5219 to zero, whereas 
\family typewriter 
G92.2
\family default 
 leaves their current values alone.
\layout Standard

To set the axis offset to the values saved in parameters 5211 to 5219, program
 
\family typewriter 
G92.3
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

You can set axis offsets in one program and use the same offsets in another
 program.
 Program 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 in the first program.
 This will set parameters 5211 to 5219.
 Do not use 
\family typewriter 
G92.1
\family default 
 in the remainder of the first program.
 The parameter values will be saved when the first program exits and restored
 when the second one starts up.
 Use 
\family typewriter 
G92.3
\family default 
 near the beginning of the second program.
 That will restore the offsets saved in the first program.
 
\layout Standard

EMC2 stores the G92 offsets and reuses them on the next run of a program.
 To prevent this, one can program a G92.1 (to erase them), or program a G92.2
 (to unapply them - they are still stored).

\layout Standard

In units per minute feed rate mode, an F word is interpreted to mean the
 controlled point should move at a certain number of inches per minute,
 millimeters per minute, or degrees per minute, depending upon what length
 units are being used and which axis or axes are moving.
\layout Standard

In units per revolution mode, an F word is interpreted to mean the controlled
 point should move a certain number of inches per revolution of the spindle,
 depending on what length units are being used and which axis or axes are
 moving.
 G95 is not suitable for threading, for threading use G33 or G76.
\layout Standard

In inverse time feed rate mode, an F word means the move should be completed
 in [one divided by the F number] minutes.
 For example, if the F number is 2.0, the move should be completed in half
 a minute.
\layout Standard

When the inverse time feed rate mode is active, an F word must appear on
 every line which has a G1, G2, or G3 motion, and an F word on a line that
 does not have G1, G2, or G3 is ignored.
 Being in inverse time feed rate mode does not affect G0 (rapid traverse)

On some machines, the carousel will move when a T word is programmed, at
 the same time machining is occurring.
 On such machines, programming the T word several lines before a tool change
 will save time.
 A common programming practice for such machines is to put the T word for
 the next tool to be used on the line after a tool change.
 This maximizes the time available for the carousel to move.

\layout Section

Differences that change the meaning of RS274NGC programs
\layout Subsection

Location after a tool change
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the machine does not return to its original position after a tool
 change.
 This change was made because the new tool might be longer than the old
 tool, and the move to the original machine position could therefore leave
 the tool tip too low.
\layout Subsection

Offset parameters are inifile units
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the values stored in parameters for the G28 and G30 home locations,
 the P1\SpecialChar \ldots{}
P9 coordinate systems, and the G92 offset are in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

inifile units
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 This change was made because otherwise the meaning of a location changed
 depending on whether G20 or G21 was active when G28, G30, G10 L2, or G92.3
 is programmed.
\layout Subsection

Tool table lengths/diameters are in inifile units
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the tool lengths (offsets) and diameters in the tool table are
 specified in inifile units only.
 This change was made because otherwise the length of a tool and its diameter
 would change based on whether G20 or G21 was active when initiating G43,
 G41, G42 modes.
 This made it impossible to run gcode in the machine's non-native units,
 even when the gcode was simple and well-formed (starting with G20 or G21,
 and didn't change units throughout the program), without changing the tool
 table.
\layout Subsection
