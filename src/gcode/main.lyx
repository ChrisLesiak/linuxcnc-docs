Language Overview
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{cha:Language-Overview}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The RS274/NGC language is based on lines of code.
 Each line (also called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

block
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) may include commands to a machining center to do several different things.
 Lines of code may be collected in a file to make a program.
\layout Standard

A typical line of code consists of an optional line number at the beginning
 followed by one or more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

words.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 A word consists of a letter followed by a number (or something that evaluates
 to a number).
 A word may either give a command or provide an argument to a command.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
G1 X3
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is a valid line of code with two words.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
G1
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is a command meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

move in a straight line at the programmed feed rate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
X3
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 provides an argument value (the value of X should be 3 at the end of the
 move).
 Most RS274/NGC commands start with either G or M (for General and Miscellaneous
).
 The words for these commands are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

G codes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

M codes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The RS274/NGC
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{RS274NGC}

\end_inset 

 language has no indicator for the start of a program.
 The Interpreter, however, deals with files.
 A single program may be in a single file, or a program may be spread across
 several files.
 A file may demarcated with percents in the following way.
 The first non-blank line of a file may contain nothing but a percent sign,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

%
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, possibly surrounded by white space, and later in the file (normally at
 the end of the file) there may be a similar line.
 Demarcating a file with percents is optional if the file has an 
\family typewriter 
M2
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
M30
\family default 
 in it, but is required if not.
 An error will be signalled if a file has a percent line at the beginning
 but not at the end.
 The useful contents of a file demarcated by percents stop after the second
 percent line.
 Anything after that is ignored.
\layout Standard

The RS274/NGC language has two commands (
\family typewriter 
M2
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
M30
\family default 
), either of which ends a program.
 A program may end before the end of a file.
 Lines of a file that occur after the end of a program are not to be executed.
 The interpreter does not even read them.
\layout Section

Format of a line
\layout Standard

A permissible line of input RS274/NGC code consists of the following, in
 order, with the restriction that there is a maximum (currently 256) to
 the number of characters allowed on a line.
\layout Enumerate

an optional block delete character, which is a slash 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 .
 
\layout Enumerate

an optional line number.
\layout Enumerate

any number of words, parameter settings, and comments.
\layout Enumerate

an end of line marker (carriage return or line feed or both).
 
\layout Standard

Any input not explicitly allowed is illegal and will cause the Interpreter
 to signal an error.
\layout Standard

Spaces and tabs are allowed anywhere on a line of code and do not change
 the meaning of the line, except inside comments.
 This makes some strange-looking input legal.
 The line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
g0x +0.
 12 34y 7
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
g0 x+0.1234 y7
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, for example.
\layout Standard

Blank lines are allowed in the input.
 They are to be ignored.
\layout Standard

Input is case insensitive, except in comments, i.e., any letter outside a
 comment may be in upper or lower case without changing the meaning of a
 line.
 
\layout Section

Line Number
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Line Number}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A line number is the letter N followed by an integer (with no sign) between
 0 and 99999 written with no more than five digits (000009 is not OK, for
 example).
 Line numbers may be repeated or used out of order, although normal practice
 is to avoid such usage.
 Line numbers may also be skipped, and that is normal practice.
 A line number is not required to be used, but must be in the proper place
 if used.
\layout Section

Word
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Word}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A word is a letter other than N followed by a real value.
\layout Standard

Words may begin with any of the letters shown in Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Words-and-their}

\end_inset 

.
 The table includes N for completeness, even though, as defined above, line
 numbers are not words.
 Several letters (I, J, K, L, P, R) may have different meanings in different
 contexts.
 Letters which refer to axis names are not valid on a machine which does
 not have the corresponding axis.

\layout Subsection

Number
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Number}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The following rules are used for (explicit) numbers.
 In these rules a digit is a single character between 0 and 9.
\layout Itemize

A number consists of (1) an optional plus or minus sign, followed by (2)
 zero to many digits, followed, possibly, by (3) one decimal point, followed
 by (4) zero to many digits - provided that there is at least one digit
 somewhere in the number.
\layout Itemize

There are two kinds of numbers: integers and decimals.
 An integer does not have a decimal point in it; a decimal does.
\layout Itemize

Numbers may have any number of digits, subject to the limitation on line
 length.
 Only about seventeen significant figures will be retained, however (enough
 for all known applications).
\layout Itemize

A non-zero number with no sign as the first character is assumed to be positive.
\layout Standard

Notice that initial (before the decimal point and the first non-zero digit)
 and trailing (after the decimal point and the last non-zero digit) zeros
 are allowed but not required.
 A number written with initial or trailing zeros will have the same value
 when it is read as if the extra zeros were not there.
\layout Standard

Numbers used for specific purposes in RS274/NGC are often restricted to
 some finite set of values or some to some range of values.
 In many uses, decimal numbers must be close to integers; this includes
 the values of indexes (for parameters and carousel slot numbers, for example),
 M codes, and G codes multiplied by ten.
 A decimal number which is supposed be close to an integer is considered
 close enough if it is within 0.0001 of an integer.
 
\layout Subsection

Numbered Parameters
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Numbered-Parameters}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A numbered parameter is the pound character 
\family typewriter 
#
\family default 
 followed by an integer between 1 and 5399.
 The parameter is referred to by this integer, and its value is whatever
 number is stored in the parameter.
 
\layout Standard

A value is stored in a parameter with the = operator; for example "
\family typewriter 
#3 = 15
\family default 
" means "set parameter 3 to 15." A parameter setting does not take effect
 until after all parameter values on the same line have been found.
 For example, if parameter 3 has been previously set to 15 and the line
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3=6 G1 x#3
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is interpreted, a straight move to a point where x equals 15 will occur
 and the value of parameter 3 will be 6.
 
\layout Standard

The 
\family typewriter 
#
\family default 
 character takes precedence over other operations, so that, for example,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#1+2
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 means the number found by adding 2 to the value of parameter 1, not the
 value found in parameter 3.
 Of course, 
\family typewriter 
#[1+2]
\family default 
 does mean the value found in parameter 3.
 The 
\family typewriter 
#
\family default 
 character may be repeated; for example 
\family typewriter 
##2
\family default 
 means the value of the parameter whose index is the (integer) value of
 parameter 2.
 
\layout Subsection

Named Parameters
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Named-Parameters}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Named parameters work like numbered parameters but are easier to read.
 All parameter names are converted to lower case and have spaces and tabs
 removed.
 Named parameters must be enclosed with 
\family typewriter 
< >
\family default 
 marks.
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
#<named parameter here>
\family default 
 is a local named parameter.
 By default, a named parameter is local to the scope in which it is assigned.
 You can't access a local parameter outside of its subroutine - this is
 so that two subroutines can use the same parameter names without fear of
 one subroutine overwriting the values in another.
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
#<_global named parameter here>
\family default 
 is a global named parameter.
 They are accessible from within called subroutines and may set values within
 subroutines that are accessible to the caller.
 As far as scope is concerned, they act just like regular numeric parameters.
 They are not stored in files.
 
\layout Standard

Examples: 
\layout Itemize

Declaration of named global variable
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
#<_endmill_dia> = 0.049
\family default 
 
\layout Itemize

Reference to previously declared global variable
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
#<_endmill_rad> = [#<_endmill_dia>/2.0]
\family default 
 
\layout Itemize

Mixed literal and named parameters
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
o100 call [0.0] [0.0] [#<_inside_cutout>-#<_endmill_dia>] [#<_Zcut>] [#<_feedrate>
]
\layout Standard

\layout Standard

Notes: 
\layout Standard

The global parameters _a, _b, _c, ...
 _z have been reserved for special use.
 In the future, they may provide access to the last Aword, Bword, Cword,
 etc.
 
\layout Subsection

Expressions
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Expressions}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

An expression is a set of characters starting with a left bracket 
\family typewriter 
[
\family default 
 and ending with a balancing right bracket 
\family typewriter 
]
\family default 
.
 In between the brackets are numbers, parameter values, mathematical operations,
 and other expressions.
 An expression is evaluated to produce a number.
 The expressions on a line are evaluated when the line is read, before anything
 on the line is executed.
 An example of an expression is 
\family typewriter 
[1 + acos[0] - [#3 ** [4.0/2]]]
\family default 
.
\layout Subsection

Binary Operators
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Binary-Operators}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Binary operators only appear inside expressions.
 There are four basic mathematical operations: addition (
\family typewriter 
+
\family default 
), subtraction (
\family typewriter 
-
\family default 
), multiplication (
\family typewriter 
*
\family default 
), and division (
\family typewriter 
/
\family default 
).
 There are three logical operations: non-exclusive or (
\family typewriter 
OR
\family default 
), exclusive or (
\family typewriter 
XOR
\family default 
), and logical and (
\family typewriter 
AND
\family default 
).
 The eighth operation is the modulus operation (
\family typewriter 
MOD
\family default 
).
 The ninth operation is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 operation (
\family typewriter 
**
\family default 
) of raising the number on the left of the operation to the power on the
 right.
 The relational operators are equality (
\family typewriter 
EQ
\family default 
), inequality (
\family typewriter 
NE
\family default 
), strictly greater than (
\family typewriter 
GT
\family default 
), greater than or equal to (
\family typewriter 
GE
\family default 
), strictly less than (
\family typewriter 
LT
\family default 
), and less than or equal to (
\family typewriter 
LE
\family default 
).
\layout Standard

The binary operations are divided into several groups according to their
 precedence.
 (see table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Operator-Precedence}

\end_inset 

) If operations in different precedence groups are strung together (for
 example in the expression 
\family typewriter 
[2.0 / 3 * 1.5 - 5.5 / 11.0]
\family default 
), operations in a higher group are to be performed before operations in
 a lower group.
 If an expression contains more than one operation from the same group (such
 as the first 
\family typewriter 
/
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
*
\family default 
 in the example), the operation on the left is performed first.
 Thus, the example is equivalent to: 
\family typewriter 
[[[2.0 / 3] * 1.5] - [5.5 / 11.0]]
\family default 
 , which is equivalent to to 
\family typewriter 
[1.0 - 0.5]
\family default 
 , which is 
\family typewriter 
0.5
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

The logical operations and modulus are to be performed on any real numbers,
 not just on integers.
 The number zero is equivalent to logical false, and any non-zero number
 is equivalent to logical true.

Comments
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{G Code Comments}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Comments}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Printable characters and white space inside parentheses is a comment.
 A left parenthesis always starts a comment.
 The comment ends at the first right parenthesis found thereafter.
 Once a left parenthesis is placed on a line, a matching right parenthesis
 must appear before the end of the line.
 Comments may not be nested; it is an error if a left parenthesis is found
 after the start of a comment and before the end of the comment.
 Here is an example of a line containing a comment: 
\family typewriter 

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

G80 M5 (stop motion)
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Comments do not cause a machining center to do anything.
\layout Section

MSG,

 appears after the left parenthesis and before any other printing characters.
 Variants of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
MSG,
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which include white space and lower case characters are allowed.
 The rest of the characters before the right parenthesis are considered
 to be a message.
 Messages should be displayed on the message display device.
 Comments not containing messages need not be displayed there.

Comments that look like: 
\family typewriter 
(debug, rest of comment)
\family default 
 are the same as comments like 
\family typewriter 
(msg, rest of comment)
\family default 
 with the addition of special handling for parameters.
\layout Standard

Comments that look like: 
\family typewriter 
(print, rest of comment)
\family default 
 are output to stderr with special handling for parameters.
\layout Section

Parameters in special comments
\layout Standard

In the DEBUG, PRINT and LOG comments, the values of parameters in the message
 are expanded.
\layout Standard

For example: to print a named global variable to stderr (the default console
 window) add a line to your gcode like...
\layout LyX-Code

(print,endmill dia = #<_endmill_dia>)
\layout Standard

Inside the above types of comments, sequences like 
\family typewriter 
#123
\family default 
 are replaced by the value of the parameter 123.
 Sequences like 
\family typewriter 
#<named parameter>
\family default 
 are replaced by the value of the named parameter.
 Remember that named parameters will have white space removed from them.
 So, 
\family typewriter 
#<named parameter>
\family default 
 is the same as 
\family typewriter 
#<namedparameter>
\family default 
.
 
\layout Section

Repeated Items
\layout Standard

A line may have any number of G words, but two G words from the same modal
 group (see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Modal-Groups}

\end_inset 

) may not appear on the same line.
\layout Standard

A line may have zero to four M words.
 Two M words from the same modal group may not appear on the same line.
\layout Standard

For all other legal letters, a line may have only one word beginning with
 that letter.
\layout Standard

If a parameter setting of the same parameter is repeated on a line, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3=15 #3=6
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, for example, only the last setting will take effect.
 It is silly, but not illegal, to set the same parameter twice on the same
 line.
\layout Standard

If more than one comment appears on a line, only the last one will be used;
 each of the other comments will be read and its format will be checked,
 but it will be ignored thereafter.
 It is expected that putting more than one comment on a line will be very
 rare.
 
\layout Section

Item order
\layout Standard

The three types of item whose order may vary on a line (as given at the
 beginning of this section) are word, parameter setting, and comment.
 Imagine that these three types of item are divided into three groups by
 type.
\layout Standard

The first group (the words) may be reordered in any way without changing
 the meaning of the line.
\layout Standard

If the second group (the parameter settings) is reordered, there will be
 no change in the meaning of the line unless the same parameter is set more
 than once.
 In this case, only the last setting of the parameter will take effect.
 For example, after the line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3=15 #3=6
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 has been interpreted, the value of parameter 3 will be 6.
 If the order is reversed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3=6 #3=15
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and the line is interpreted, the value of parameter 3 will be 15.
\layout Standard

If the third group (the comments) contains more than one comment and is
 reordered, only the last comment will be used.
\layout Standard

If each group is kept in order or reordered without changing the meaning
 of the line, then the three groups may be interleaved in any way without
 changing the meaning of the line.
 For example, the line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
g40 g1 #3=15 (foo) #4=-7.0
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 has five items and means exactly the same thing in any of the 120 possible
 orders (such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#4=-7.0 g1 #3=15 g40 (foo)
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) for the five items.
 
\layout Section

Commands and Machine Modes
\layout Standard

In RS274/NGC, many commands cause a machining center to change from one
 mode to another, and the mode stays active until some other command changes
 it implicitly or explicitly.
 Such commands are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

modal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 For example, if coolant is turned on, it stays on until it is explicitly
 turned off.
 The G codes for motion are also modal.
 If a G1 (straight move) command is given on one line, for example, it will
 be executed again on the next line if one or more axis words is available
 on the line, unless an explicit command is given on that next line using
 the axis words or cancelling motion.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Non-modal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 codes have effect only on the lines on which they occur.
 For example, G4 (dwell) is non-modal.
 
\layout Section

Modal Groups
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Modal Groups}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Modal-Groups}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Modal commands are arranged in sets called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

modal groups
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, and only one member of a modal group may be in force at any given time.
 In general, a modal group contains commands for which it is logically impossibl
e for two members to be in effect at the same time - like measure in inches
 vs.
 measure in millimeters.
 A machining center may be in many modes at the same time, with one mode
 from each modal group being in effect.
 The modal groups are shown in Table

\layout Standard

For several modal groups, when a machining center is ready to accept commands,
 one member of the group must be in effect.
 There are default settings for these modal groups.
 When the machining center is turned on or otherwise re-initialized, the
 default values are automatically in effect.
\layout Standard

Group 1, the first group on the table, is a group of G codes for motion.
 One of these is always in effect.
 That one is called the current motion mode.
\layout Standard

It is an error to put a G-code from group 1 and a G-code from group 0 on
 the same line if both of them use axis words.
 If an axis word-using G-code from group 1 is implicitly in effect on a
 line (by having been activated on an earlier line), and a group 0 G-code
 that uses axis words appears on the line, the activity of the group 1 G-code
 is suspended for that line.
 The axis word-using G-codes from group 0 are G10, G28, G30, and G92.
 
\layout Standard

It is an error to include any unrelated words on a line with 
\family typewriter 
O-
\family default 
 flow control.

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Order-of-Execution}

 of each item on the line, but by the following list:

G Code Best Practices
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{G Code Best Practices}

\end_inset 


\layout Section

Use an appropriate decimal precision
\layout Standard

Use at least 3 digits after the decimal when milling in millimeters, and
 at least 4 digits after the decimal when milling in inches.
 In particular, arc tolerance checks are made to .001 and .0001 depending
 on the active units.
\layout Section

Use consistent white space
\layout Standard

G-code is most legible when at least one space appears before words.
 While it is permitted to insert white space in the middle of numbers, there
 is no reason to do so.
\layout Section

Prefer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Center-format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 arcs
\layout Standard

Center-format arcs (which use 
\family typewriter 
I- J- K-
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
R-
\family default 
) behave more consistently than R-format arcs, particularly for included
 angles near 180 or 360 degrees.
\layout Section

Put important modal settings at the top of the file
\layout Standard

When correct execution of your program depends on modal settings, be sure
 to set them at the beginning of the part program.
 Modes can carry over from previous programs and from the MDI commands.
\layout Standard

As a good preventative measure, put a line similar to the following at the
 top of all your programs:
\layout LyX-Code

G17 G20 G40 G49 G54 G80 G90 G94 
\layout Standard

(XY plane, inch mode, cancel diameter compensation, cancel length offset,
 coordinate system 1, cancel motion, non-incremental motion, feed/minute
 mode)
\layout Standard

Perhaps the most critical modal setting is the distance units--If you do
 not include G20 or G21, then different machines will mill the program at
 different scales.
 Other settings, such as the return mode in canned cycles may also be important.
\layout Section

Don't put too many things on one line
\layout Standard

Ignore everything in Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Order-of-Execution}

\end_inset 

, and instead write no line of code that is the slightest bit ambiguous.
 Similarly, don't use and set a parameter on the same line, even though
 the semantics are well defined.
 (Exception: Updating a variable to a new value, such as 
\family typewriter 
#1=[#1+#2
\family default 
])
\layout Section

Don't use line numbers
\layout Standard

Line numbers offer no benefits.
 When line numbers are reported in error messages, the numbers refer to
 the line number in the file, not the N-word value.
\layout Section

When moving more than one coordinate system, consider inverse time feed
 mode
\layout Standard

Because the meaning of an F-word in feed-per-minute mode varies depending
 on which axes are commanded to move, and because the amount of material
 removed does not depend only on the feed rate, it may be easier to use
 G93 inverse time feed mode to achieve the desired material removal rate.

G Codes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{G Codes}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

G codes of the RS274/NGC language are shown in Table 5 and described following
 that.
\layout Standard

In the command prototypes, the hyphen (
\family typewriter 
-
\family default 
) stands for a real value.
 As described earlier, a real value may be (1) an explicit number, 
\family typewriter 
4
\family default 
, for example, (2) an expression, 
\family typewriter 
[2+2]
\family default 
, for example, (3) a parameter value, 
\family typewriter 
#88
\family default 
, for example, or (4) a unary function value, 
\family typewriter 
acos[0]
\family default 
, for example.
\layout Standard

In most cases, if axis words (any or all of 
\family typewriter 
X-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
Y-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
Z-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
A-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
B-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
C-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
U-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
V-
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
W-
\family default 
) are given, they specify a destination point.
 Axis numbers are in the currently active coordinate system, unless explicitly
 described as being in the absolute coordinate system.
 Where axis words are optional, any omitted axes will have their current
 value.
 Any items in the command prototypes not explicitly described as optional
 are required.
 It is an error if a required item is omitted.
 In prototypes, this will be written as 
\family typewriter 
\emph on 
axes
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

In the prototypes, the values following letters are often given as explicit
 numbers.
 Unless stated otherwise, the explicit numbers can be real values.
 For example, 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2
\family default 
 could equally well be written 
\family typewriter 
G[2*5] L[1+1]
\family default 
.
 If the value of parameter 100 were 2, 
\family typewriter 
G10 L#100
\family default 
 would also mean the same.
 Using real values which are not explicit numbers as just shown in the examples
 is rarely useful.
\layout Standard

If 
\family typewriter 
L-
\family default 
 is written in a prototype the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
-
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will often be referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

L number
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Similarly the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
-
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in 
\family typewriter 
H-
\family default 
 may be called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

H number
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, and so on for any other letter.

\layout Standard

Two formats are allowed for specifying an arc: Center Format and Radius
 Format.
\layout Subsection

Center format arcs (preferred format)
\layout Standard

In the center format, the coordinates of the end point of the arc in the
 selected plane are specified along with the offsets of the center of the
 arc from the current location.
 In this format, it is OK if the end point of the arc is the same as the
 current point.
 It is an error if:
\layout Itemize

When the arc is projected on the selected plane, the distance from the current
 point to the center differs from the distance from the end point to the
 center by more than 0.0002 inch (if inches are being used) or 0.002 millimeter
 (if millimeters are being used).
\layout Standard

When the XY-plane is selected, program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 I- J-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
).
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of X and Y must
 be used.
 I and J are the offsets from the current location (in the X and Y directions,
 respectively) of the center of the circle.
 I and J are optional except that at least one of the two must be used.
 If only one is specified, the value of the other is taken as 0.
 If you include the Z word it will spiral.
 It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

X and Y are both omitted
\layout Itemize

or I and J are both omitted.
\layout Standard

When the XZ-plane is selected, program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 I- K-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
).
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of X and Z must
 be used.
 I and K are the offsets from the current location (in the X and Z directions,
 respectively) of the center of the circle.
 I and K are optional except that at least one of the two must be used.
 If only one is specified, the value of the other is taken as 0.
 It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

X and Z are both omitted, 
\layout Itemize

or I and K are both omitted.
\layout Standard

When the YZ-plane is selected, program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 J- K-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
).
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of Y and Z must
 be used.
 J and K are the offsets from the current location (in the Y and Z directions,
 respectively) of the center of the circle.
 J and K are optional except that at least one of the two must be used.
 If only one is specified, the value of the other is taken as 0.
 It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

Y and Z are both omitted
\layout Itemize

or J and K are both omitted.
\layout Standard

Here is an example of a center format command to mill an arc: 
\family typewriter 
G17 G2 x10 y16 i3 j4 z9
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

That means to make a clockwise (as viewed from the positive z-axis) circular
 or helical arc whose axis is parallel to the Z-axis, ending where X=10,
 Y=16, and Z=9, with its center offset in the X direction by 3 units from
 the current X location and offset in the Y direction by 4 units from the
 current Y location.
 If the current location has X=7, Y=7 at the outset, the center will be
 at X=10, Y=11.
 If the starting value of Z is 9, this is a circular arc; otherwise it is
 a helical arc.
 The radius of this arc would be 5.
\layout Standard

In the center format, the radius of the arc is not specified, but it may
 be found easily as the distance from the center of the circle to either
 the current point or the end point of the arc.
 
\layout Subsection

Full Circles
\layout Standard

To do a full 360 circle from the current location only program the I, J
 or K offset from the current location for the G2/3.
 It is an error to use the K offset in the XY plane, the J offset in the
 XZ plane, and the I in the YZ plane.
 To program a spiral in the XY plane just include the Z word.
\layout Subsection

Radius format arcs (discouraged format)
\layout Standard

In the radius format, the coordinates of the end point of the arc in the
 selected plane are specified along with the radius of the arc.
 Program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 R-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
).
 R is the radius.
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of the two words
 for the axes in the selected plane must be used.
 The R number is the radius.
 A positive radius indicates that the arc turns through less than 180 degrees,
 while a negative radius indicates a turn of more than 180 degrees.
 If the arc is helical, the value of the end point of the arc on the coordinate
 axis parallel to the axis of the helix is also specified.
\layout Standard

It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

both of the axis words for the axes of the selected plane are omitted
\layout Itemize

the end point of the arc is the same as the current point.
\layout Standard

It is not good practice to program radius format arcs that are nearly full
 circles or nearly semicircles because a small change in the location of
 the end point will produce a much larger change in the location of the
 center of the circle (and, hence, the middle of the arc).
 The magnification effect is large enough that rounding error in a number
 can produce out-of-tolerance cuts.
 For instance, a 1% displacement of the endpoint of a 180 degree arc produced
 a 7% displacement of the point 90 degrees along the arc.
 Nearly full circles are even worse.
 Other size arcs (in the range tiny to 165 degrees or 195 to 345 degrees)
 are OK.
\layout Standard

Here is an example of a radius format command to mill an arc:
\family typewriter 
 G17 G2 x 10 y 15 r 20 z 5.
\layout Standard

That means to make a clockwise (as viewed from the positive Z-axis) circular
 or helical arc whose axis is parallel to the Z-axis, ending where X=10,
 Y=15, and Z=5, with a radius of 20.
 If the starting value of Z is 5, this is an arc of a circle parallel to
 the XY-plane; otherwise it is a helical arc.

\layout Standard

Program G7 to enter the diameter mode for axis X on a lathe.
 When in the Diameter mode the X axis moves on a lathe will be 1/2 the distance
 to the center of the lathe.
 For example X1 would move the cutter to 0.500
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:G10:-Set-Coordinate}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The RS274/NGC language view of coordinate systems is described in Section
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Coordinate-Systems}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

To set the origin of a coordinate system, program 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2 P- 
\emph on 
axes
\family default 
\emph default 
, where the P number is in the range 1 to 9 (corresponding to 
\family typewriter 
G54
\family default 
 to 
\family typewriter 
G59.3
\family default 
) and all axis words are optional.
 The origin of the coordinate system specified by the P number is set to
 the given values (in terms of the not offset machine coordinate system).
 Only those coordinates for which an axis word is included on the line will
 be set.
 Being in incremental distance mode (
\family typewriter 
G91
\family default 
) has no effect on 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

the P number does not evaluate to an integer in the range 1 to 9.
\layout Standard

If a 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 origin offset was in effect before 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2
\family default 
, it will continue to be in effect afterwards.
\layout Standard

The coordinate system whose origin is set by a 
\family typewriter 
G10
\family default 
 command may be active or inactive at the time the 
\family typewriter 
G10
\family default 
 is executed.
 If it is currently active, the new coordinates take effect immediately.
\layout Standard

Example: 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2 P1 x 3.5 y 17.2
\family default 
 sets the origin of the first coordinate system (the one selected by 
\family typewriter 
G54
\family default 
) to be X=3.5 and Y=17.2.
 Because only X and Y are specified, the origin point is only moved in X
 and Y; the other coordinates are not changed.

The tool will pause briefly for synchronization before each threading pass,
 so a relief groove will be required at the entry unless the beginning of
 the thread is past the end of the material or an entry taper is used.
\layout Standard

Unless using an exit taper, the exit move (traverse to original X) is not
 synchronized to the spindle speed.
 With a slow spindle, the exit move might take only a small fraction of
 a revolution.
 If the spindle speed is increased after several passes are complete, subsequent
 exit moves will require a larger portion of a revolution, resulting in
 a very heavy cut during the exit move.
 This can be avoided by providing a relief groove at the exit, or by not
 changing the spindle speed while threading.

Canned Cycles
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Canned Cycles}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:G81-to-G89:}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The canned cycles 
\family typewriter 
G81
\family default 
 through 
\family typewriter 
G89
\family default 
 are described in this section.
 Two examples are given with the description of 
\family typewriter 
G81
\family default 
 below.
\layout Standard

All canned cycles are performed with respect to the currently-selected plane.
 Any of the six planes may be selected.
 Throughout this section, most of the descriptions assume the XY-plane has
 been selected.
 The behavior is analogous if another plane is selected, and the correct
 words must be used.
 For instance, in the 
\family typewriter 
G17.1
\family default 
 plane, the action of the canned cycle is along W, and the locations or
 increments are given with U and V.
 In this case substitute U,V,W for X,Y,Z in the instructions below.
\layout Standard

Rotational axis words are allowed in canned cycles, but it is better to
 omit them.
 If rotational axis words are used, the numbers must be the same as the
 current position numbers so that the rotational axes do not move.
\layout Subsection

Common Words
\layout Standard

All canned cycles use X, Y, R, and Z words.
 The R (usually meaning retract) position is along the axis perpendicular
 to the currently selected plane (Z-axis for XY-plane, etc.) Some canned
 cycles use additional arguments.
\layout Subsection

Sticky Words
\layout Standard

For canned cycles, we will call a number 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

sticky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 if, when the same cycle is used on several lines of code in a row, the
 number must be used the first time, but is optional on the rest of the
 lines.
 Sticky numbers keep their value on the rest of the lines if they are not
 explicitly programmed to be different.
 The R number is always sticky.
\layout Standard

In incremental distance mode X, Y, and R numbers are treated as increments
 from the current position and Z as an increment from the Z-axis position
 before the move involving Z takes place.
 In absolute distance mode, the X, Y, R, and Z numbers are absolute positions
 in the current coordinate system.
\layout Standard

The L number is optional and represents the number of repeats.
 
\begin_inset Formula $L=0$
\end_inset 

 is not allowed.
 If the repeat feature is used, it is normally used in incremental distance
 mode, so that the same sequence of motions is repeated in several equally
 spaced places along a straight line.
 In absolute distance mode, 
\begin_inset Formula $L>1$
\end_inset 

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

do the same cycle in the same place several times,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Omitting the L word is equivalent to specifying 
\begin_inset Formula $L=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The L number is not sticky.
\layout Subsection

Repeat Cycle
\layout Standard

When 
\begin_inset Formula $L>1$
\end_inset 

 in incremental mode with the XY-plane selected, the X and Y positions are
 determined by adding the given X and Y numbers either to the current X
 and Y positions (on the first go-around) or to the X and Y positions at
 the end of the previous go-around (on the repetitions).
 Thus, if you program 
\family typewriter 
L10
\family default 
, you will get 10 cycles.
 The first cycle will be distance X,Y from the original location.
 The R and Z positions do not change during the repeats.
\layout Subsection

Retract Mode
\layout Standard

The height of the retract move at the end of each repeat (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

clear Z
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the descriptions below) is determined by the setting of the retract
 mode: either to the original Z position (if that is above the R position
 and the retract mode is 
\family typewriter 
G98
\family default 
, OLD_Z), or otherwise to the R position.
 See Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:G98,-G99:-Set}

\end_inset 


\layout Subsection

Canned Cycle Errors
\layout Standard

It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

X, Y, and Z words are all missing during a canned cycle, 
\layout Itemize

a P number is required and a negative P number is used, 
\layout Itemize

an L number is used that does not evaluate to a positive integer, 
\layout Itemize

rotational axis motion is used during a canned cycle, 
\layout Itemize

inverse time feed rate is active during a canned cycle, 
\layout Itemize

or cutter radius compensation is active during a canned cycle.
\layout Standard

If the XY plane is active, the Z number is sticky, and it is an error if:
 
\layout Itemize

the Z number is missing and the same canned cycle was not already active,
 
\layout Itemize

or the R number is less than the Z number.
\layout Standard

If other planes are active, the error conditions are analogous to the XY
 conditions above.
\layout Subsection

Preliminary and In-Between Motion
\layout Standard

At the very beginning of the execution of any of the canned cycles, if the
 current Z position is below the R position, the Z-axis is traversed to
 the R position.
 This happens only once, regardless of the value of L.
\layout Standard

In addition, at the beginning of the first cycle and each repeat, the following
 one or two moves are made
\layout Enumerate

a straight traverse parallel to the XY-plane to the given XY-position, 
\layout Enumerate

a straight traverse of the Z-axis only to the R position, if it is not already
 at the R position.
 
\layout Standard

If another plane is active, the preliminary and in-between motions are analogous.

To make the current point have the coordinates you want (without motion),
 program 
\family typewriter 
G92 X- Y- Z- A- B- C- U- V- W- 
\family default 
, where the axis words contain the axis numbers you want.
 All axis words are optional, except that at least one must be used.
 If an axis word is not used for a given axis, the coordinate on that axis
 of the current point is not changed.
 It is an error if: 
\layout Enumerate

all axis words are omitted.
\layout Standard

When 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 is executed, the origins of all coordinate systems move.
 They move such that the value of the current controlled point, in the currently
 active coordinate system, becomes the specified value.
 All coordinate systems' origins are offset this same distance.
 
\layout Standard

For example, suppose the current point is at X=4 and there is currently
 no 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 offset active.
 Then 
\family typewriter 
G92 x7
\family default 
 is programmed.
 This moves all origins -3 in X, which causes the current point to become
 X=7.
 This -3 is saved in parameter 5211.
\layout Standard

Being in incremental distance mode has no effect on the action of 
\family typewriter

\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 offsets may be already be in effect when the

\family default 
.
\layout Standard

You can set axis offsets in one program and use the same offsets in another

\layout Standard

In units per minute feed rate mode, an F word is interpreted to mean the
 controlled point should move at a certain number of inches per minute,
 millimeters per minute, or degrees per minute, depending upon what length
 units are being used and which axis or axes are moving.
\layout Standard

In units per revolution mode, an F word is interpreted to mean the controlled

 depending on what length units are being used and which axis or axes are
 moving.
 G95 is not suitable for threading, for threading use G33 or G76.
\layout Standard

In inverse time feed rate mode, an F word means the move should be completed
 in [one divided by the F number] minutes.
 For example, if the F number is 2.0, the move should be completed in half
 a minute.
\layout Standard

When the inverse time feed rate mode is active, an F word must appear on

Differences between EMC2 gcode and RS274NGC
\layout Section

Differences that change the meaning of well-formed RS274NGC programs
\layout Subsection

Location after a tool change
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the machine does not return to its original position after a tool
 change.
 This change was made because the new tool might be longer than the old
 tool, and the move to the original machine position could therefore leave
 the tool tip too low.
\layout Subsection

Offset parameters are inifile units
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the values stored in parameters for the G28 and G30 home locations,
 the P1\SpecialChar \ldots{}
P9 coordinate systems, and the G92 offset are in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

inifile units
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 This change was made because otherwise the meaning of a location changed
 depending on whether G20 or G21 was active when G28, G30, G10 L2, or G92.3
 is programmed.
\layout Subsection

Tool table lengths/diameters are in inifile units
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the tool lengths (offsets) and diameters in the tool table are
 specified in inifile units only.
 This change was made because otherwise the length of a tool and its diameter
 would change based on whether G20 or G21 was active when initiating G43,
 G41, G42 modes.
 This made it impossible to run gcode in the machine's non-native units,
 even when the gcode was simple and well-formed (starting with G20 or G21,
 and didn't change units throughout the program), without changing the tool
 table.
