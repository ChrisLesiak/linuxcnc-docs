\begin_layout Chapter
RS274NGC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Differences that change the meaning of RS274NGC programs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Location after a tool change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In EMC2, the machine does not return to its original position after a tool
 change.
 This change was made because the new tool might be longer than the old
 tool, and the move to the original machine position could therefore leave
 the tool tip too low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Offset parameters are inifile units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In EMC2, the values stored in parameters for the G28 and G30 home locations,
 the P1...P9 coordinate systems, and the G92 offset are in "inifile units".
 This change was made because otherwise the meaning of a location changed
 depending on whether G20 or G21 was active when G28, G30, G10 L2, or G92.3
 is programmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Tool table lengths/diameters are in inifile units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In EMC2, the tool lengths (offsets) and diameters in the tool table are
 specified in inifile units only.
 This change was made because otherwise the length of a tool and its diameter
 would change based on whether G20 or G21 was active when initiating G43,
 G41, G42 modes.
 This made it impossible to run gcode in the machine's non-native units,
 even when the gcode was simple and well-formed (starting with G20 or G21,
 and didn't change units throughout the program), without changing the tool
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
G84, G87 not implemented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
G84 and G87 are not currently implemented, but may be added to a future
 release of EMC2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
G28, G30 with axis words
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When G28 or G30 is programmed with only some axis words present, EMC2 only
 moves the named axes.
 This is common on other machine controls.
 To move some axes to an intermediate point and then move all axes to the
 predefined point, write two lines of gcode:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
G0 X- Y- (axes to move to intermediate point) G28 (move all axes to predefined
 point)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
M62, M63 not implemented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
M62 and M63 are not currently implemented, but may be added to a future
 release of EMC2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Differences that do not change the meaning of RS274NGC programs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
G33, G76 threading codes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These codes are not defined in RS274NGC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
G38.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probe tip is not retracted after a G38.2 movement.
 This retraction move may be added in a future release of EMC2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
G38.3...G38.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These codes are not defined in RS274NGC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
O-codes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These codes are not defined in RS274NGC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
M50...M53 overrides
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These codes are not defined in RS274NGC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
M61..M66
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These codes are not defined in RS274NGC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
G43, G43.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Negative Tool Lengths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RS274NGC spec says "it is expected that" all tool lengths will be positive.
 However, G43 works for negative tool lengths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Lathe tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
G43 tool length compensation can offset the tool in both the X and Z dimensions.
 This feature is primarily useful on lathes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dynamic tool lengths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EMC2 allows specification of a computed tool length through G43.1 I K.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
G41.1, G42.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EMC2 allows specification of a tool diameter and, if in lathe mode, orientation
 in the gcode.
 The format is G41.1/G42.1 D L, where D is diameter and L (if specified) is
 the lathe tool orientation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
G43 without H word
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In ngc, this is not allowed.
 In EMC2, it sets length offsets for the currently loaded tool.
 If no tool is currently loaded, it is an error.
 This change was made so the user doesn't have to specify the tool number
 in two places for each tool change, and because it's consistent with the
 way G41/G42 work when the D word is not specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
U, V, and W axes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EMC2 allows machines with up to 9 axes by defining an additional set of
 3 linear axes known as U, V and W
