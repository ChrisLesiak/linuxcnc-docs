 operator.
 For normal motion, drive this bit TRUE.
\end_layout

\family typewriter
M53\InsetSpace ~
P1
\family default
, and this bit is TRUE, the feed rate is set to 0.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
motion.program-line (s32, out) The current program line while executing.
 Zero if not running or between lines while single stepping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
motion.spindle-at-speed (bit, in) Motion will pause until this pin is TRUE,
 under the following conditions: before the first feed move after each spindle
 start or speed change; before the start of every chain of spindle-synchronized
 moves; and if in CSS mode, at every rapid to feed transition.
 This input can be used to ensure that the spindle is up to speed before
 starting a cut, or that a lathe spindle in CSS mode has slowed down after
 a large to small facing pass before starting the next pass at the large
 diameter.
 Many VFDs have an "at speed" output.
 Otherwise, it is easy to generate this signal with the 
\family typewriter
HAL near

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 by 1.0 for each rotation of the spindle in the clockwise (
\family typewriter
M3
\family default
) direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
motion.spindle-speed-in (float, in) Feedback of actual spindle speed in rotations
 per second.
 This is used by feed-per-revolution motion (
\family typewriter
G95
\family default

 If your spindle encoder driver does not have a velocity output, you can
 generate a suitable one by sending the spindle position through a 
\family typewriter
ddt
\family default
 component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
motion.spindle-speed-out (float, out) Commanded spindle speed in rotations
 per minute.
 Positive for spindle forward (
