<TITLE> pluto_servo: EMC2 Servo control for Pluto-P </TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<H1> About pluto_servo</H1>
<P><B>Pluto_servo</B> is an <A HREF="http://linuxcnc.org/">emc2</A> software
driver and associated firmware that allow the Pluto-P board to be used to
control a servo-based CNC machine.  The Pluto-P is an inexpensive ($60) FPGA
board featuring the ACEX1K chip from Altera.  Pluto_servo is released
under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.

The pluto_servo system is suitable for control of a 4-axis CNC mill with servo
motors, a 3-axis mill with PWM spindle control, a lathe with spindle encoder,
etc.  The large number of inputs allows a full set of limit switches.

<P>The board features:
<UL>
<LI> 4 quadrature channels with 40MHz sample rate.  The counters operate in
"4x" mode.  The maximum useful quadrature rate is 8191 counts per emc2 servo
cycle, or about 8MHz for EMC2's default 1ms servo rate.  An axis with index
pulse must have fewer than 8192 counts per revolution.
<LI> 4 PWM channels, "up/down" or "pwm+dir" style.  4095 duty cycles from -100%
to +100%, including 0%.  The PWM period is approximately 19.5kHz (40MHz /
2047).  A PDM-like mode is also available.
<LI> 18 digital outputs: 10 dedicated, 8 shared with PWM functions. (Example: A
lathe with unidirectional PWM spindle control may use 13 total digital outputs)
<LI> 20 digital inputs: 8 dedicated, 12 shared with Quadrature functions.
(Example: A lathe with index pulse only on the spindle may use 13 total digital
inputs)
<LI> EPP communication with the PC.  The EPP communication typically takes
around 100uS on machines tested so far, enabling servo rates above 1kHz. 
</UL>

<P class=box>
<B>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</B>

<H1>Requirements</H1>
<UL>
<LI> A Pluto-P board
<LI> An EPP-compatible parallel port, configured for EPP mode in the system BIOS
<LI> The CVS HEAD version of emc2 from 12/19 or later.
</UL>

<H1>Obtaining the source code</H1>
<P>The source code (including the verilog source code and Quartus project
files) is included with the emc2 source in the <tt>src/hal/drivers/</tt>
directory.

<H1>Compilation and installation</H1>
<P>Pluto_servo is built by the normal emc2 build process.

<H2>Rebuilding the FPGA firmware</H2>
<P>Like the HAL hardware driver, the FPGA firmware is licensed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  The
<tt>src/hal/drivers/pluto_servo_firmware/</tt> subdirectory contains the
Verilog HDL source code plus additional files used by Quartus&mdash;which are
"scripts used to control compilation"&mdash;for the FPGA firmware.  Altera's
Quartus II software is required to rebuild it.  The <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre">gratis</A> version of
Quartus II runs only on Microsoft Windows, although there is apparently a paid
version that runs on Linux.  To rebuild the firmware from the .hdl and other
source files, open <tt>pluto_servo.qpf</tt> and press CTRL-L.  Then, in Linux,
recompile emc2.

<H1>Notes:</H1>
<H2>Connectors</H2>
<P>The Pluto-P board is shipped with the left connector presoldered, with the
key in the indicated position.  The other connectors are unpopulated.  There
does not seem to be a standard 12-pin IDC connector, but some of the pins of a
16P connector can hang off the board next to QA3/QZ3.

<P>The bottom and right connectors are on the same .1" grid, but the left
connector is not.  If OUT2&hellip;OUT9 are not required, a single IDC connector
can span the bottom connector and the bottom two rows of the right connector.

<H2>Pins</H2>
<P>Read the <A
HREF="http://www.altera.com/literature/ds/acex.pdf">ACEX1K datasheet</A> for
information about input and output voltage thresholds.  The pins are all
configured in "LVTTL/LVCMOS" mode and are generally compatible with 5V TTL logic.

<P>Before configuration and after properly exiting emc2, all Pluto-P pins are
tristated with weak pull-ups (20k&Omega; min, 50k&Omega; max).  However,
software bugs in the pluto_servo firmware or emc2, or a crash of the computer
where emc2 is running, can leave the Pluto-P pins in an undefined state.

<P>When the device is unprogrammed, the LED glows faintly.  When the device is
programmed, the LED glows according to the duty cycle of PWM0 (LED = UP0 <i>xor</i> DOWN0).

<P>In pwm+dir mode, by default dir is HIGH for negative values and LOW for
positive values.  To select HIGH for positive values and LOW for negative
values, set the corresponding dout-NN pin HIGH to invert the signal.

<P>The index input is triggered on the rising edge.  Initial testing has shown
that the QZx inputs are particularly noise sensitive, due to being polled every
25ns.  Digital filtering has been added to filter pulses shorter than 150ns
(six polling times).  Additional external filtering, such as a Schmitt buffer
or inverter, RC filter, or differential receiver (if applicable) is
recommended.

<P>The IN1&hellip;IN7 pins have 22-ohm series resistors to their associated FPGA
pins.  No other pins have any sort of protection for out-of-spec voltages or
currents.  It is up to the integrator to add appropriate isolation and
protection.  Traditional parallel port optoisolator boards do not work
with pluto_servo due to the bidirectional nature of the EPP protocol.

<H2>Power</H2>
<P>A small amount of current may be drawn from VCC.  The available current
depends on the unregulated DC input to the board.  Alternately, regulated
+3.3VDC may be supplied to the FPGA through these VCC pins.  The required
current is not yet known, but is probably around 50mA plus I/O current.

<P>The regulator on the Pluto-P board is a low dropout type.  Supplying 5V at
the power jack will allow the regulator to work properly.

<H2>PC interface</H2>
<P>The "software EPP emulation" (<tt>epp_soft=1</tt>) is only partially
implemented.  An EPP-capable parallel port is currently a requirement.

<P>At present, only a single pluto_servo board is supported.  At present there
is no provision for multiple boards on one parallel port (all boards reside at
the same EPP address) but supporting one board per parallel port should be
possible.

<H2>Input latching and output updating</H2>
<P>PWM duty cycles for each channel are updated at different times.
<P>digital outputs OUT0 through OUT9 are all updated at the same
time.  Digital outputs OUT10 through OUT17 are updated at the same time as the pwm function they are shared with.
<P>Digital inputs IN0 through IN19 are all latched at the same time.
<P>Quadrature positions for each channel are latched at different times.

<H1>For more information</H1>
<P>A list of all HAL function names, pin names and parameter names is in the
manual page, <A HREF="http://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/man/man9/pluto_servo.9.html"><tt>pluto_servo.9</tt></A>.

<P>The Pluto-P board may be ordered from <A
HREF="http://www.knjn.com/ShopBoards_Parallel.html">knjn.com</A> (US based,
international shipping is available).  Some additional information about it is
available from <A
HREF="http://www.fpga4fun.com/board_pluto-P.html">fpga4fun.com</A> and from <A
HREF="http://emergent.unpy.net/01165081407">my blog</A>.

<P>A schematic for a 2A, 2-axis PWM servo amplifier board is <A
HREF="http://emergent.unpy.net/projects/01148303608">available</A>.  The <A
HREF="http://www.st.com/stonline/books/pdf/docs/1773.pdf">L298 H-bridge</A> is
inexpensive and can easily be used for motors up to 4A (one motor per L298) or
up to 2A (two motors per L298) with the supply voltage up to 46V.  However, the
L298 does not have built-in current limiting, a problem for motors with high
stall currents.  For higher currents and voltages, some users have reported
<A HREF="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25929">success</A> with
International Rectifier's integrated high-side/low-side drivers.

<H2>The details of the register set</H2>
<P>The EPP protocol works by reading and writing values from registers on the
connected device.  However, the details of the register set are subject to
change between releases of pluto_servo.
