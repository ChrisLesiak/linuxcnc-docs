\end_inset 

Halcmd
\layout Standard

Halcmd is a command line tool for manipulating the HAL.
 There is a rather complete man page for halcmd, which will be installed
 if you have installed EMC2 from either source or a package.
 If you have compiled EMC2 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

run-in-place
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, the man page is not installed, but it is accessible.
 From the main EMC2 directory, do:
\layout LyX-Code

$ 
\series bold 
man -M docs/man halcmd
\layout Standard

Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cha:HAL-Tutorial}

\end_inset 

 has a number of examples of halcmd usage, and is a good tutorial for halcmd,
 while this section is a detailed reference listing all of the available
 commands.
\layout Subsection


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:HalcmdUsage}

\end_inset 

Usage
\layout LyX-Code

halcmd [<options>] [<command>[<args>]]
\layout LyX-Code

\layout Subsection


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:HalcmdOptions}

\end_inset 

Options
\layout LyX-Code

-f [<filename>]
\layout Standard

File mode: Ignores commands on command line, takes input from
\shape italic 
 
\family typewriter 
<
\shape default 
filename>
\family default 
 instead.
 If 
\family typewriter 
<filename>
\family default 
 is not specified, takes input from 
\family typewriter 
stdin
\family default 
.
\layout LyX-Code

-k
\layout Standard

Keep going after failed command(s).
 The default is to stop and return failure if any command fails.
\layout LyX-Code

-q
\layout Standard

Quiet: Prints messages only when errors occur.
 This is the default.
 
\layout LyX-Code

-Q
\layout Standard

Extra quiet: Prints nothing, executes commands silently.
 Note that some commands like 
\family typewriter 
show
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
save
\family default 
 do nothing except print some information.
 Giving the 
\family typewriter 
-Q
\family default 
 option to one of those commands prevents the information from being printed,
 making the command pointless.
\layout LyX-Code

-s
\layout Standard

Script mode: Modified how 
\family typewriter 
show
\family default 
 outputs information.
 Supresses headers, and prints most lists (e.g.
 thread functions, signal pins) on a single line.
 Suppresses the 
\family typewriter 
halcmd:
\family default 
 prompt if 
\family typewriter 
-f
\family default 
 is also specified (for use by other programs that issue commands via a
 pipe).
\layout LyX-Code

-v
\layout Standard

Verbose: Prints messages showing the results of each command.
\layout LyX-Code

-V
\layout Standard

Extra Verbose: Prints lots of debugging messages.
 Very messy, not normally used.
\layout LyX-Code

-h
\layout Standard

Help: Prints a help screen and exits.
\layout Subsection


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:HalcmdCommands}

\end_inset 

Commands
\layout Standard

Commands tell 
\series bold 
halcmd
\series default 
 what to do.
 If invoked without the -f option, 
\series bold 
halcmd
\series default 
 reads the remainder of the command line and treats it as a single command.
 If invoked with the
\series bold 
 
\family typewriter 
\series default 
-f
\family default 
 option, halcmd reads the specified file and treats each line as a command.
 The -f option allows you to very quickly execute a whole series of commands,
 and is the most common way to configure the HAL.
\layout LyX-Code

#
\layout Standard

Commands starting with '
\family typewriter 
#
\family default 
' are considered to be comments, and are ignored by halcmd.

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:HalcmdLoad/unload}

\end_inset 

Loading/unloading modules
\layout LyX-Code

loadrt <compname> [<arg1>] [<arg2>]
\layout Standard

Load realtime component: Loads the realtime HAL component 
\family typewriter 
<compname>
\family default 
, passing it configuration arguments 
\family typewriter 
<arg1>
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
<arg2>
\family default 
, etc.
 Halcmd uses the external program emc_module_helper to load the module.
 If 
\family typewriter 
<compname>
\family default 
 is not found in the directory that emc_module_helper expects to contain
 the components, the command will fail.
\layout LyX-Code

unloadrt <compname>
\layout Standard

Unload realtime component: Unloads the realtime HAL component 
\family typewriter 
<compname>
\family default 
.
 Halcmd uses the external program emc_module_helper to unload the module.
 If 
\family typewriter 
<compname>
\family default 
 is not loaded, the command will fail.
\layout Subsubsection


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:CreatingSignals}

\end_inset 

Creating Signals
\layout LyX-Code

newsig <signame> <type>
\layout Standard

New signal: Creates a new HAL signal called 
\family typewriter 
<signame>
\family default 
 that may later be used to connect two or more HAL pins.
 
\family typewriter 
<type>
\family default 
 is the data type of the new signal, and must be one of
\series bold 
 
\family typewriter

 If a signal of the same name already exists, the command will fail.
 
\layout LyX-Code

delsig <signame>
\layout Standard

Delete signal: Deletes a HAL signal called 
\family typewriter 
<signame>
\family default 
.
 Any pins currently linked to the signal will be unlinked.
 If a signal called

linksp <signame> => <pinname>
\layout LyX-Code

linksp <signame> <= <pinname>
\layout LyX-Code

linksp <signame> <=> <pinname>
\layout Standard

Link pin to signal; Link signal to pin: Establishes a link between a HAL
 component pin 
\family typewriter 
<pinname>
\family default 
 and a HAL signal 
\family typewriter 
<signame>
\family default 
.
 Any previous link to

\family default 
 will be broken.

\family default 
, or 
\family typewriter 
<=>
\family default 
, are optional, and are ignored by halcmd.
 They should not be used on the command line, as the shell is likely to
 misinterpret them.
 However, when writing commands in a file, the arrows can be used to indicate
 which direction data flows through the link.
 The future confusion they prevent may be your own! The two forms 
\family typewriter 
linksp
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
linkps
\family default 
 are provided for the same reason.
 Using the appropriate one for the situation can make a file easier to understan
d, however they both have the exact same effect.
 If either 
\family typewriter 
<pinname>
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
<signame>
\family default 
 does not exist, or if their types don't match, the command will fail.

linkpp <pinname1> => <pinname2>
\layout LyX-Code

linkpp <pinname1> <= <pinname2>
\layout LyX-Code

linkpp <pinname1> <=> <pinname2>
\layout Standard

Link pin to pin: Establishes a link between two HAL component pins 
\family typewriter 
<pinname1>
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
<pinname2>
\family default 
.
 A signal is created with the same name and type as 
\family typewriter 
pinname1
\family default 
, and both the named pins are connected to the newly created signal.
 This is the equivalent of issuing the following three commands:
\layout LyX-Code

newsig pinname1_type pinname1
\layout LyX-Code

linksp pinname1 pinname1
\layout LyX-Code

linksp pinname1 pinname2

unlinkp <pinname>
\layout Standard

Unlink pin: Breaks any previous link to 
\family typewriter

\family default 
 does not exist, or does not have a signal linked to it, the command will
 fail.

\end_inset 

Setting Values
\layout LyX-Code

setp <paramname> <value>
\layout LyX-Code

<paramname> = <value>
\layout Standard

Set parameter: Sets the value of parameter 
\family typewriter 
<paramname>
\family default 
 to 
\family typewriter 
<value>
\family default 
.
 The second form of the command has exactly the same effect, but is provided
 for use in files where it may make the file more readable.
 The second form is not recommended on the command line, since the shell
 may misinterpret the equal sign.
 If 
\family typewriter 
<paramname>
\family default 
 does not exist, or if it is not writable, the command will fail.
 It will also fail if 
\family typewriter 
<value>
\family default 
 is not a legal value for 
\family typewriter 
<paramname>
\family default 
's data type.
 For example, 
\family typewriter 
300

\family default 
.
 If 
\family typewriter

 It will also fail if 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:FunctionsThreads}

\end_inset 

Configuring Functions and Threads
\layout LyX-Code

addf <functname> <threadname> [<position>]
\layout Standard

Add function: Adds function 
\family typewriter 
<functname>
\family default 
 to realtime thread 
\family typewriter 
<threadname>
\family default 
.
 
\family typewriter 
<position>
\family default 
 determines where in the thread the function is added, and thus in what
 order the thread's functions will execute.
 If 
\family typewriter 
<position>
\family default 
 is positive, the function will be inserted in the corresponding location
 relative to the beginning of the thread.
 Thus if 
\family typewriter 
<position>
\family default 
 is 1, the function will be inserted at the beginning of the thread, and
 if it is 3 it will be inserted as the third function in the thread.
 If 
\family typewriter 
<position>
\family default 
 is negative, the function will be inserted relative to the end of the thread.
 So -1 means the last function, and -2 is next to last, etc.
 Zero is illegal.
 If no position is specified, -1 is assumed, and the function is inserted
 at the end of the thread.
 If either 
\family typewriter 
<functname>
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
<threadname>
\family default 
 does not exist, the command will fail.
 It will also fail if the function requires floating point and the thread
 does not support it, or if the function is non-reentrant and is already
 in a thread.
 It also fails if 
\family typewriter 
<position>
\family default 
 specifies something impossible, for example asking for position 3 when
 the thread only has one function in it.
\layout LyX-Code

delf <functname> <threadname>
\layout Standard

Delete function: Removes function 
\family typewriter 
<functname>
\family default 
 from realtime thread 
\family typewriter 
<threadname>
\family default 
.
 The command will fail if either
\family typewriter 
 <functname>
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
<threadname>
\family default 
 does not exist, or if 
\family typewriter 
<functname>
\family default 
 is not currently part of 
\family typewriter 
<threadname>
\family default 
.
 If the function appears in the thread more than once, only the first instance
 is deleted.
\layout LyX-Code

newthread <threadname> <period>
\layout Standard

New thread: Creates a new realtime thread that can be used to execute HAL
 functions at specific intervals.
 The thread is called 
\family typewriter 
<threadname>
\family default 
, and it executes every 
\family typewriter 
<period>
\family default 
 nano-seconds.
 If a thread of the same name already exists, the command will fail.
 
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

This command is NOT currently implemented.
 It requires some complex user/kernel calling procedures, and may not be
 working in time for the NAMES show and demonstration.
 At the present time, threads can only be created by kernel modules, not
 by a user space process like halcmd.
 A number of the existing kernel module HAL components have provisions for
 creating threads when they are insmod'ed.
\end_inset

delthread <threadname>
\layout Standard

Delete thread: Deletes a realtime thread called

 Any functions currently linked to the thread will be unlinked.
 If a thread called 
\family typewriter

Halmeter
\layout Standard

Halmeter is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

voltmeter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for the HAL.
 It lets you look at a pin, signal, or parameter, and displays the current
 value of that item.
 It is pretty simple to use.
 Start it by typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
halmeter
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in a X windows shell.
 Halmeter is a GUI application.
 It will pop up a small window, with two buttons labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Select
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Exit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Exit is easy - it shuts down the program.
 Select pops up a larger window, with three tabs.
 One tab lists all the pins currently defined in the HAL.
 The next lists all the signals, and the last tab lists all the parameters.
 Click on a tab, then click on a pin/signal/parameter.
 Then click on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

OK
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The lists will disappear, and the small window will display the name and
 value of the selected item.
 The display is updated approximately 10 times per second.
 If you click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Accept
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

OK
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, the small window will display the name and value of the selected item,
 but the large window will remain on the screen.
 This is convenient if you want to look at a number of different items quickly.
 You can have many halmeters running at the same time, if you want to monitor
 several items.
 If you want to launch a halmeter without tying up a shell window, type
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
halmeter &
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to run it in the background.
 You can also make halmeter start displaying a specific item immediately,
 by adding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
pin|sig|par[am] <name>
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to the command line.
 It will display the pin, signal, or parameter <name> as soon as it starts.
 (If there is no such item, it will simply start normally.)
\layout Standard

Halmeter is due for a rewrite - the new version will have a nicer display,
 with autoranging, range hold, and an analog bar graph to supplement the
 digital display.
 However its purpose will remain the same - a handy software equivalent
 to DMM for basic testing and troubleshooting.
